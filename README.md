# 🎶 System Sound Prank 🎶
A fun little prank to replace your system's device connect and disconnect sounds with custom .wav files.

⚠️ Warning: This script modifies system sound settings. It's intended for fun but use it responsibly and make sure you have permission to modify the target computer.

📁 Repository Contents
set_sounds.bat: The main script that replaces the system sounds.

reset.bat: The script to revert the changes and restore the original sounds.

🚀 How to Use
Step 1: Clone the Repository
To ensure the scripts work correctly, please clone this repository directly to your C drive using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/kumar-shaurya/device_connect_prank.git C:\device_connect_prank

Step 2: Prepare the Files
Navigate to the C:\device_connect_prank folder.

Make sure the .wav files are named exactly connect.wav and disconnect.wav.

Step 3: Run the Prank
Simply double-click set_sounds.bat.

A command prompt window will briefly flash as the script runs.

The system sounds for "Device Connected" and "Device Disconnected" will now play your custom sounds.

Step 4: Enjoy the Prank!
Now, whenever a USB device is plugged in or unplugged, your custom sounds will play.

🔄 How to Reset the Sounds
To return the system sounds to their original state, just double-click reset.bat. This will restore the default Windows sounds for these events.

Note: The reset.bat file is crucial for a good prank—and for good manners! Don't forget to run it afterward to restore the original system sounds.

📝 Troubleshooting
"The system cannot find the file specified.": Make sure that all the .bat and .wav files are in the correct directory (C:\device_connect_prank).

No sound after running the script?: Check that your custom .wav files are not corrupted and are correctly named.
